# ToDoList
This is the repository of the app ToDoList. It's a notekeeping like app, to save locally on your smartphone
simple one-liner reminders. It is easy to use, very lightweight and compatible with most modern hardware.
It's real purpose is to show up my skills with software engineering techniques and tools. This app was
originally made in Java with MVP architecture, but I've recently ported it to Kotlin, and updated it with
Jetpack Room with coroutines, the coordinator and the constraint layout libraries, Google Material Design,
AndroidX RecyclerView, and the MVVM architecture with databinding.

It is currently licensed under MIT license, so feel free to use it as you please.

Also, I would like to thanks and attribute some icons and images used in this app to the following
